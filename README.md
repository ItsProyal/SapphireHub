# Counter Blox Skin Changer Revamp [Testing Phase]

So currently we are in the testing phase of the revamp, I don't have any accounts and altgen.club is currently down.
Therefor I have just been brain storming ideas, and thinking about ways to do this.
I believe I have found the ways I am going to do this, such as the Skins will all be grabbed via the games storage rather than grabbed from a client side table that we manually setup. This will mean whenever something is changed through Counter Blox, we will automatically be updated to that.
We also are adding better custom skin support, before we would manually add them at the bottom of the script making it look like a mess.
That has now changed, we will now be using JSON to do this. This switch was used for many reasons, such as, cleaning up the script, ease of access, ability for users to add there own skins easily, ability for us to setup a featured skin list, and a bunch more for the backend process.
